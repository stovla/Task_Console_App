# Task_Console_App

This is a small C# console app that uses 3 types of inputs and 3 types of outputs with MySql database

For the database I used WAMP server with PHPMyAdmin.

The database input uses an existing database with one collection, so it is basically outputing all of the information from the same.

Next time I can add an functon when Database Input is selected, to use a string which indicates the name of the collection from that same database. Or even the two option to choose the database as well.
That way, multiple collections can be chosen individualy.
